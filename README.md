ODIN LIBRARY 

Reading books is fun, but sometimes keeping track them without help takes too much work. That's where this project comes in, this web app will take the users input and create a tabled catalog of books that the user types down. 

User input*

The users input will then be made into a table automatically and all of the information of the book the user types down will be organized by Title, Author, pages, and status of if read or not.
